In this section we give a brief description to each of our benchmarks. Unless we state otherwise, all benchmarks are fully annotated and use Timer.py, a class from our utilities library benchmark_tools. This allows us to measure the time taken for each configuration to run. Similarly, all benchmarks are written by us, unless we state otherwise. In case of the adopted benchmarks, we state any changes made such as adding missing type annotations.
Some of the benchmarks were scaled to run multiple iterations of the program because the runtime was too small to notice a significant difference across the various configurations. We denote that in the benchmark descriptions.

@parag{Sample_FSM}
Represents how individuals interact with each other in a population. 


@parag{Take5}
Simulates a Take5 game.
The benchmark runs 500 consecutive  simulations of the  game.

@parag{Evolution}
Simulates an Evolution game. 
Since the number of functions in this benchmark was too large, we annotated three files which represent all card plays a player can make during a turn.


@parag{Espionage}
Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Kruskal's algorithm.

@parag{slowSHA}
Adapted from @citet[vksb-dls-2014]. Originally from
@url{http://github.com/sfstpala/SlowSHA}  Computes SHA-1  and SHA-512 for a
sequence of English words.

@parag{PythonFlow} @note{masphei-2013}
Implements Ford-Fulkerson's Algorithm for finding the maximum flow of a graph. 

@parag{N-Queens} @note{@url{https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Demos/benchmarks/nqueens.py}}. A simple brute-force N-Queens solver.

@parag{CallMethods}
A Microbenchmark for evaluating the overhead of function calls. It consists of 32*10^5 calls to trivial functions. The calls do not use varargs or
kwargs, and do not use tuple unpacking. 

@parag{CallMethodSlots}
A Microbenchmark for measuring the overhead of function calls  that that define __slots__ and that have no __dict__ attribute. The calls do not use varargs or kwargs, and do not use tuple unpacking.
When an object has no __dict__ attribute, the JIT can optimize away most of the
attribute lookup. This benchmark measures this optimization. 

@parag{Float}
Generates and normalizes a list of points then maximizes them. Adapted from [??]. We added missing type annotations.

@parag{Futen} @note{@url{https://benchmarksgame.com}}
Removed unit test class, nose dependency and jinja2 renderer. 

@parag{Go}
Adapted from @citet[vksb-dls-2014] with the following changes: Refactored benchmark into three files and only Squares.py because the number of functions in the benchmark was too large.

@parag{Chaos} @note{@url{https://github.com/dropbox/pyston/blob/master/minibenchmarks/chaos.py}}
Creates chaosgame-like fractals. We fully annotated this benchmark.


@parag{Fannkuch} @note{@url{http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/}}
"The fannkuch benchmark is defined by programs in Performing Lisp Analysis of the FANNKUCH Benchmark, Kenneth R. Anderson and Duane Rettig. FANNKUCH is an abbreviation for the German word Pfannkuchen, or pancakes, in analogy to flipping pancakes. The conjecture is that the maximum count is approximated by n*log(n) when n goes to infinity."
We fully annotated this benchmark.

@parag{http2}


@parag{Meteor} @note{@url{http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/}}
Implements a solution to the Meteor puzzle. We fully annotated this benchmark.

@parag{N_Body} @note{@url{https://benchmarksgame.com}}
"Model the orbits of Jovian planets, using the same simple symplectic-integrator."
We fully annotated this benchmark.

@parag{PiDigits} @note{@url{http://shootout.alioth.debian.org}}
Computes some of the digits of Ï€ to stress big integer arithmetic. We changed NDIGITS to `5000` and fully annotated the benchmark.

@parag{SpectralNorm}  @note{@url{https://benchmarksgame.com}}
Computes the spectral norm of a matrix. We removed main function and fully annotated the benchmark.
