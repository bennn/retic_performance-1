stats
===

Benchmark based on the case study from _Design and Evaluation of Gradual Typing for Python_.

- `pstat.py` 
- `typed_math.py` typed API to Python's built-in math library
- `main.py` adapted from Mike's `testallstats.py`

Notes:

- removed functions from `stats.py` that were not used in `main.py`
- removed functions from `pstat.py` that were not used in 
- removed optional arguments
- removed calls to `dyn`
- removed nested definitions
- TODO add types everyone (monomorphic, because experiment)
